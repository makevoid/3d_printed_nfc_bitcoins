# 3D Printed NFC Bitcoins

Hi! Francesco here.
Probably we met at DevCore London and I handed you a physical 3D Printed Bitcoin with an NFC tag inside it.
The bitcoin (the NFC tag really) contains a link to this page and a bitcoin private key!!!
The private key **should contain 10 mBTC** (~1.5 GBP atm)

#### To retrieve them,

- scan the NFC tag with an android phone
- the NFC dialog will pop up linking you to this url and to an SMS action
- select an SMS app, the SMS app will open and the body of the message will be the private key
- copy it in the clipboard
- open Mycelium or another bitcoin wallet, hit Cold Storage Spending / Import Private Key and choose the one from the clipboard
- congratz! you have 10 mbtc


I couldn't think about a best solution at the moment, the sms seemed the only one to let you copy-paste the pvt key.

Sorry if I messed up and your coin doesn't work, I was sleepy last night when I loaded them :D

Enjoy
Francesco
